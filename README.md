###### GPT is interesting, let's use it to create a better world.

This README.md file will guide you through the process of integrating the GPT-4 API into your PHP-based website, enabling chat functionality using OpenAI's API.

## Prerequisites
- PHP 7.4 or higher installed on your web server
- A web server with support for PHP (e.g., Apache or Nginx)
- Knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for designing the chat interface)
- An API key for the GPT API from Openai.com

## API Key
- Register for an account or log in to the OpenAI platform.
- Navigate to the API Keys section and generate a new API key.
- Store the API key safely, as you will need it in the next step.

## Setting Up
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in `config.php` with your actual API key.
3. Upload `index.html`, `config.php`, `process.php` to your web server.
4. Ensure the `uploads` folder exists and is writable by the web server.
5. Access `index.html` in your browser (e.g., https://yourdomain.com/index.html).
6. Type a message in the chat input field and press Enter or click the Send button to send the message.
7. The OpenAI API should respond with a message from the language model.
8. Be cautious and set limits on your OpenAI Dashboard.

Be sure to customize the application as needed to fit your requirements.
